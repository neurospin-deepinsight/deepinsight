deepinsight: Meta Module providing Deep Learning Tools for PyTorch 
==================================================================

\:+1: If you are using the code please add a star to the repository :+1:

The ``deepinsight`` package consists of popular datasets, model architectures,
and common image transformations for medical brain images.
This library is built upon PyTorch.

This work is made available by a `community of people
<https://github.com/neurospin-deepinsight/deepinsight/blob/master/AUTHORS.rst>`_,
amoung which the CEA Neurospin BAOBAB laboratory.
